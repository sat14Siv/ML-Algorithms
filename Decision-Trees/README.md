This is a tutorial offered by Jason Brownlee of Machine Learning Mastery. (https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-decision-tree-algorithm-scratch-python/)
The CART algorithm was used to predict whether a bank note is authentic or given a number of measures taken from a photograph.
The data is purely numeric and hence the code only works for numeric data.

The dataset can be found on http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication#

Although I followed the tutorial, I used pandas and wrote the code mostly on my own so there might be a few differences between the code shown in the tutorial and this.

The code prints the depth of the node along with the node values and leaves to get a better understanding of how the decision tree is being built. I found that very helpful.
