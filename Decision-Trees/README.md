This is a tutorial offered by Jason Brownlee of Machine Learning Mastery.
The CART algorithm was used to predict whether a bank note is authentic or given a number of measures taken from a photograph.

The dataset can be found on http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication#

Although I followed the tutorial, I used pandas as I am more comfortable in it whereas the tutorial did not.
